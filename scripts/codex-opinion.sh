# Second opinion by Codex (gpt-6-astra) on something the team settled: a PRD, a plan, a decision, a feature
# shape. The documents are copied into a plain snapshot of HEAD (git archive: no .git, untracked secrets and
# data unreachable), so an uncommitted draft is visible to Codex only through the explicit copies below.
# Codex may read the code to check the claims. Asks for the case against first, then a verdict, so a bare
# "looks good" cannot come back.

Read CLAUDE.md first: it carries the project invariants and the landmines already paid for. Then read: __NAMES__. These describe something the team has settled on. You may read the code to check any claim they make; do not read .claude/PRPs/reports.

Question: __QUESTION__

Answer in this order, briefly: (1) the strongest case against what was settled: what breaks, what is simpler, what was missed, each tied to a file or an invariant where possible; (2) what you would change, concretely; (3) a one-line verdict: agree / agree with the changes above / disagree. No praise, no restating the document.

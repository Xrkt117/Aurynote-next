# aurynote design document

Living reference for the app in `Xrkt117/Aurynote-next` on `main`. Current design baseline: version 0.4.5 with tutorial and song charts. Last reviewed: October 2, 2026. The product name remains **aurynote**.

This document describes implemented behavior, its visual design, and where it is built. Update the relevant sections whenever a feature or interaction changes. Ideas are not implemented features until explicitly marked as shipped here.

## Product direction

Help musicians across instrument-key families connect hearing, notation, and playing. Beginners should always know what to do next, which note they are hearing, and whether an answer was correct. Teach relationships with a reference pitch and gradual practice; do not promise absolute pitch.

The app runs locally in Electron with React and TypeScript. It works without an account or server. The Java prototype is retained for reference; this document covers the continued React/Electron implementation.

## Visual language

| Element | Design rule | Current implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Surface | Quiet off-white canvas with white practice panels | Canvas `#f8f8f5`, white panels |
| Text | Dark primary text, readable muted supporting text | Ink `#252622`, muted `#60645d` |
| Boundaries | Thin, visible borders; restrained corners | Border token `#d1d4ca`; common button radius 6px |
| Typography | Sans-serif controls with selective editorial emphasis | Inter if available, Segoe UI/Arial fallback; Georgia/Times for the studio heading and card titles; musical notation uses symbol glyphs where required |
| Primary action | Filled dark button with a clear verb | Start, Next, playback and completion actions |
| Selection | Make the chosen mode visibly different | Dark selected navigation and segmented controls; selected pattern has a left border |
| Success | Green plus words and a check symbol | Brief “Correct!” popup with a check; solid green answer border |
| Mistake | Warm rust plus words and a different border | Dashed answer border; “Your answer”; rust feedback panel |
| Music identity | Show root, degree, note and symbol separately | Root tile, degree labels, chord symbol, keyboard markers |
| Decoration | Sparse musical and botanical details | Playback waves, staff notation, keyboard markers, abstract leaves, quiet layered fills, and Lucide icons |
| Motion | Short transitions that explain state changes | Subtle button transitions, playback wave, question entry, review countdown |

Maintain the monochrome foundation. Green and rust communicate meaning; they are not general decoration. Do not rely on color alone. Reserve serif type and illustrative details for the studio hierarchy, keep practice-task controls direct, and avoid large rounded pills, excessive shadows, long paragraphs, and unrelated visual treatments for equivalent controls.

Styles live in [style.css](../desktop/src/style.css). Shared primitives live in [components.tsx](../desktop/src/components.tsx): brand, tags, section titles, keyboard, waveform, staff and empty state.

## App structure and global controls

[App.tsx](../desktop/src/App.tsx) owns navigation and the shared profile through [context.ts](../desktop/src/context.ts). The left sidebar contains six destinations, a restrained botanical quote card, and local-save status. The dark active destination has a light inset border so selection remains visible without relying on color alone. The top bar shows the current screen with Practice context, a clearly labeled Instrument key selector grouped by key with instrument examples, and a text-labeled Settings button. The studio uses musical staff lines, notation details, waveforms, and abstract botanical forms as quiet decoration. The practice screens retain their focused layouts without decorative tip cards. A persistent Quick tour button follows the navigation. The old help dialog, new-feature dot, sidebar progress summary, and footer slogans remain removed. Temporary notifications remain for errors and export status.

| Destination | Purpose | Screen source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Your studio | Choose a next practice step | [StudioDashboard.tsx](../desktop/src/StudioDashboard.tsx) |
| Ear training | Learn and identify pitches | [Ear.tsx](../desktop/src/Ear.tsx) |
| Staff reading | Identify written notes | [StaffPractice.tsx](../desktop/src/StaffPractice.tsx) |
| Scales & chords | Hear and find playable harmony | [Explore.tsx](../desktop/src/Explore.tsx) |
| Play it back | Match a pitch on an instrument | [PlayRoom.tsx](../desktop/src/PlayRoom.tsx) |
| Your progress | Review stored practice | [Progress.tsx](../desktop/src/Progress.tsx) |

Navigation stops existing playback. Changing instrument key or notation remounts ear, staff, and microphone practice so an old question does not continue under new settings. Scales & chords preserves its selected mode and chart while updating displayed notation. Changing playback sound preserves the screen. Escape closes Settings or the tour and stops sound; it is not a universal pause control outside Settings.

The desktop window starts at 1320 by 900, with an 880 by 680 minimum. CSS adapts at 1500, 1150, 900, and 650 pixels. Smaller layouts reflow cards and controls; some supplementary tips are hidden, but ear and staff practice settings remain reachable. The navigation scrolls horizontally on phones, with Quick tour always available beside the brand. The narrower browser layouts are supported by CSS, but the packaged desktop window retains its minimum size.

## Click-through feature tour

[QuickTour.tsx](../desktop/src/QuickTour.tsx) provides seven short steps: studio, instrument/sound settings, ear training, staff reading, scales/chords and chord changes, microphone matching, and progress. A native modal highlights the corresponding real navigation or global control and shows one explanation at a time. Next and Back change steps; Skip tour, Close, Escape, and the final Done exit. It does not navigate away from the current practice screen or create practice answers.

A dismissible studio invitation appears until the tour is dismissed or completed. The `tourSeen` profile flag remembers that choice; Quick tour remains available for replay. Focus moves to each new step heading, Tab stays among the dialog buttons, and closing restores focus and page/navigation scroll. Small windows clamp the card inside the viewport; very short windows scroll within the card. There is no forced animation or automatic first-run modal.

Opening the tour stops playback, pauses answer-review timers, and cancels active or pending microphone input through the shared `practicePaused` state. Closing resumes review timing but does not restart sound or microphone access. An interrupted mystery note can be replayed manually. The tour itself never requests microphone permission.

## Instrument keys and Settings

Instrument key and playback sound are independent. The compact top-bar Instrument selector groups presets by C, B♭, E♭, F, and A. Short labels such as “Tenor sax · B♭” replace full sentences inside the control; its tooltip and Settings retain the complete instrument examples. Octave variants remain distinct: choosing only a key would otherwise make tenor and trumpet microphone targets differ by an octave.

| Key | Examples in selector | Sounding pitch relative to written |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C | Piano, flute, violin, oboe | Same pitch |
| C | Guitar, double bass | 12 semitones lower |
| C | Piccolo | 12 semitones higher |
| B♭ | Trumpet, clarinet, soprano sax | 2 semitones lower |
| B♭ | Tenor sax, bass clarinet | 14 semitones lower |
| E♭ | Alto sax | 9 semitones lower |
| E♭ | Baritone sax | 21 semitones lower |
| E♭ | E♭ clarinet | 3 semitones higher |
| F | Horn, English horn | 7 semitones lower |
| A | A clarinet | 3 semitones lower |

Examples follow common modern notation conventions; instruments with alternative score conventions need the matching preset. These are notation presets, not new recorded instrument sounds. Yamaha's [saxophone guide](https://www.yamaha.com/en/musical_instrument_guide/saxophone/play/play003.html) and [clarinet guide](https://www.yamaha.com/en/musical_instrument_guide/clarinet/mechanism/mechanism005.html) explain key-based transposition.

Settings is a compact native modal dialog with two labeled sections. Playback contains six voices (Piano, Sax, Clarinet, Flute, Trumpet, Guitar), volume with percentage, and Preview sound. Notation contains Written / Concert display options and the selected instrument family. Preview plays written C4 or concert C4 according to the chosen notation; it does not alter the key. These controls save immediately.

Opening Settings stops current playback, pauses question advancement, and stops microphone input. Closing it restores keyboard focus to the invoking button. Escape, Close, Done, or a backdrop click dismiss the dialog; native modal behavior keeps Tab focus inside. Microphone input requires a new Start action afterward. Key or notation changes begin a fresh practice screen while preserving recorded progress.

The shared success popup is centered near the top of the viewport, green with a check and “Correct!” text. It does not take focus or capture clicks. A short entry/exit animation lasts 850 milliseconds; reduced-motion mode displays it without animation. Its status role announces success. Ear training and staff reading share it; microphone matching retains its steady-match state and manual next-note control.

## Practice activity calendar

[PracticeActivity.tsx](../desktop/src/PracticeActivity.tsx) adds a year of activity to Your Progress. Each saved ear, staff, or microphone answer contributes to its local calendar day. The header reports the answer total and active-day count for the last 365 days. An empty state invites the first answer; no demo activity is mixed into the profile.

The shared [GitHubCalendar](../desktop/src/components/ui/git-hub-calendar.tsx) accepts date-string/count entries and an optional color scale. Its default colors match GitHub; the app passes an olive palette. Optional today and activityLabel props support deterministic previews and practice-specific wording. It derives state from props instead of copying strings into Date-typed state. Duplicate days are summed; malformed, negative, future, and out-of-window data is excluded. Calendar dates are parsed locally to avoid UTC shifting. Real week boundaries determine month-label positions. Padding outside the rolling year is blank and noninteractive.

Each square has a dated accessible name and tooltip. A single tab stop enters the grid; arrows move by day or week, Home/End jump to the range endpoints, and the selected day's count appears below. The legend represents 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4+ answers. Small windows scroll within the calendar without widening the page. The live wrapper refreshes the date each minute while mounted. Data comes from the retained 2,000-answer history, and that limit is stated beside the chart; this is not GitHub account activity or unlimited historical tracking.

UI infrastructure now includes Tailwind v4 through the Vite plugin, TypeScript/Vite aliases, components.json, and cn(). Reusable UI components live in desktop/src/components/ui, imported through @/components/ui. The existing flat components.tsx remains for existing app primitives. Tailwind theme/utilities are loaded separately from style.css; Preflight is intentionally omitted to preserve existing styles. See [UI setup](UI_SETUP.md) for paths and CLI instructions. No image assets or new context provider are needed.

## Your studio

**Layout:** an editorial “Train your ear” heading with a quiet decorative staff, an optional tour invitation, a large next-lesson card, a microphone practice card, one compact five-part statistics strip, and four equal practice-mode cards. The full-width workspace grows with the desktop window instead of remaining inside a fixed content cap. The next lesson is the primary action; the microphone card is a parallel secondary entry point. Ear training, staff reading, harmony, and pitch matching remain one click away below it. The year calendar and achievement cards live on Your Progress instead of lengthening the studio landing screen.

**Behavior:** the lesson card reflects the saved level. Its preview renders the actual lesson note pool and labels pitches introduced in this lesson as New and pitches from the previous lesson as Review; these are curriculum labels, not claims about the user’s mastery. Each tile has a labeled sound control, and Preview the notes plays the full pool in order with the selected voice, tuning, notation, and volume. A note count and new-note count summarize the preview. Larger pools switch to a compact grid. Starting or opening lesson details enters ear training.

The microphone card previews the shape of the matching experience without claiming to show live input before permission is granted. Its waveform, sample note, and listen/play/match indicator are illustrative and hidden from assistive technology; Start pitch matching and How it works both open Play it back. The privacy note remains visible.

Statistics show today's attempts against the configurable daily goal, overall saved accuracy, distinct pitches correctly recognized in ear training, the current consecutive practice-day streak, and completed sessions. The streak continues across today or yesterday and resets after a missed full day. Empty metrics show zero or “No answers yet”; the studio does not invent session duration because time is not stored. Detailed goals, achievements, calendar history, and pitch performance remain on Your Progress.

**Accessibility and responsive behavior:** real buttons provide all navigation and playback. Individual note buttons have pitch-specific accessible names and pressed state during playback. Decorative notation and microphone previews are ignored by assistive technology. At narrower desktop widths the feature cards stack, metrics reflow from five columns to three, two, and one, and practice modes reflow from four columns to two and then one. The microphone card remains available at the packaged app’s minimum width.

**Implementation:** [StudioDashboard.tsx](../desktop/src/StudioDashboard.tsx) reads the shared profile and lesson definitions and uses the existing audio lifecycle. Attempt counts come from retained history; completed sessions, discovered pitches, and passed guided lessons persist separately. The daily goal is configurable from 5 to 50 answers and counts all practice modes. It is a daily target, not a session limit. [style.css](../desktop/src/style.css) contains the reference-led shell, studio cards, illustrative details, and responsive rules; no raster assets or remote resources are required.

## Ear training

**Layout:** lesson heading and question count; a pre-session setup panel with mode, lesson or note-count selector, question count, and custom note buttons; main listening panel with status, waveform, prompt, answer tiles, and keyboard; a compact practice-settings column. The three-step indicator and decorative listening-tip card have been removed. Wrong-answer feedback stays in the main panel; correct answers use the shared popup.

**Lesson progression:** C and G; C/E/G; C/D/E/G/A; seven natural notes; all twelve pitch classes. Choose any of the five guided lessons, or use custom practice with 2–12 specific notes. The note-count control expands the pool in a beginner-friendly order (C, G, E, D, A, F, B, then accidentals); individual toggles select the exact pitches. Scale-degree mode restricts custom choices to the seven C-major naturals. Choose 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 40 questions; the effective total is at least the selected note count so each pitch occurs once. A shuffled first pass covers the pool before missed-note weighting begins. A score of at least 80% marks that guided lesson passed and recommends the next one; custom/degree sessions do not advance the guided path. Scale-degree completion explicitly describes degree practice instead of asking the user to pass a guided lesson.

**States and interactions:**

1. Learn: configure the pool and session length, then tap notes before beginning. Reference C and scale-degree mode are configurable here. Only selected keyboard pitches can play. Playback labels name the learning note; cancellation clears its highlight.
2. Quiz: hear a mystery note, optionally preceded by C. Scale-degree mode plays a C-major reference pattern first. Answers stay disabled during playback; Replay repeats the question.
3. Review: lock the answer, record the attempt, mark the correct tile, and identify a wrong selection separately. Incorrect answers automatically play the chosen pitch followed by the correct pitch.
4. Advance: show a non-interactive “Correct!” popup for 850 milliseconds and move straight to the next question. There is no correct-answer review panel or Pause/Next row. Incorrect answers retain 3.2 seconds of review after comparison audio finishes, with Pause, Compare again, and Next. Compare again pauses automatic advancement. Opening Settings pauses advancement until it closes.
5. Complete: show percentage, correct-answer count, distinct pool size, and pass/next-step information. A passed guided session offers “Next lesson” with the new note count; selecting it updates the local lesson immediately. “Choose notes / practice again” returns to setup; the studio also starts at the saved recommendation. Completion is counted once even if a timer and navigation action overlap. “Change practice” cancels the current question and returns to setup; previously recorded answers remain saved, but an unfinished session does not count as completed.

**Playback clarity:** live labels distinguish “Reference · C,” the home-key pattern, “Mystery note · your turn,” “Your answer,” and “Correct note.” The mystery label never reveals the answer. A short question-entry motion and updated question number mark transitions. The decorative wave indicates playback, not a measured audio waveform.

**Implementation:** the screen owns its phase, live lesson selection, queue, selected answer, pause state, and timers. The former mount-time lesson reference was removed because it kept replaying the old pool after progression. [practice.ts](../desktop/src/practice.ts) handles pool resizing, shuffling, and completion updates. Generation tokens prevent stale playback callbacks after navigation. Lesson definitions and weighted selection live in [music.ts](../desktop/src/music.ts).

## Staff reading

**Layout:** a single full-width exercise card contains a compact question toolbar, three labeled segmented controls for clef, note set, and answer method, a framed notation sheet, and a separated answer area. The prompt and listening action sit directly above the response controls. The current question and session score remain visible without competing with the staff. On narrow layouts, toolbar controls wrap and answer choices move to two columns. The former detached settings column and decorative clef-landmark card are removed.

**Behavior:** choose treble or bass clef, natural notes or accidentals, and four choices or typed text. Each segmented control exposes its selected state and starts a fresh question when changed. The selected option is disabled so clicking it again does not skip a question. Typed answers accept ordinary `#` and `b` spellings and normalize them to musical accidentals. The expected spelling must match the written note; this is a notation exercise, not an enharmonic equivalence quiz. Octave numbers are not required.

Answers lock after submission. A correct answer shows the same 850-millisecond “Correct!” popup as ear training, then advances. Wrong answers identify the selected answer and correct note with labels and different borders. The 3.2-second review has Pause / Resume and Next note controls; Hear note pauses a wrong-answer review for a closer listen. Settings and the tour pause advancement. Attempts are stored; the running score is local to this screen session.

**Implementation:** [StaffPractice.tsx](../desktop/src/StaffPractice.tsx), the shared SVG `Staff` component, and `staffNote` in music.ts. Timers and sound are cleaned up when leaving. Answer options are sampled from a finite shuffled list, avoiding the former unbounded random-selection loop.

## Scales and chords

**Layout:** a visible Scales / Chords / Chord changes switch; concert-key selector and pattern list on the left; three sections on the right:

1. Identity: scale name or chord symbol, short explanation, and transposition summary.
2. Notes to play: individual spelled note tiles with scale/chord degrees. The root has a distinct border and “Home note” label; sounding tiles show “Playing.”
3. Find the pattern: one-octave keyboard, playback, and tempo controls.

**Available scales:** major, natural minor, harmonic minor, ascending melodic minor, major pentatonic, minor pentatonic, blues, Dorian, and Mixolydian.

**Available chords:** major, minor, major seventh (Δ7), minor seventh (m7), dominant seventh (7), ninth (9), thirteenth (13), suspended fourth (sus4), suspended second (sus2), dominant ninth suspended fourth (9sus4), diminished (°), diminished seventh (°7), half-diminished (ø7), and augmented (+). The dominant thirteenth voicing omits the eleventh.

**Behavior:** all twelve concert roots are selectable. Tap a tile to hear a specific note, play the complete pattern, or stop it. All key families can hear chords together or as arpeggios. This is a listening option, not a claim that every listed instrument can play simultaneous notes. Playback sound no longer controls available harmony actions. Tempo ranges from 50 to 160 BPM; the audio engine adds separation/release, so this is a pacing control rather than a metronome-accurate rhythm exercise.

**Notation:** the selected instrument-key preset determines transposition independently of sound. Tenor written pitch is fourteen semitones above sounding pitch: concert C major is written D major. C instruments without octave transposition share written and concert pitches. The identity panel must always distinguish notes to play from the concert key. Key-specific degree spelling, including double accidentals when needed, comes from music.ts. Starting octave is displayed. Harmony roots are octave-adjusted so their written starting pitches lie between C4 and B4; this is not a full instrument-range or fingering model. The keyboard folds notes into one octave; extended chord tiles preserve their actual playback pitches.

**Implementation:** Explore.tsx renders `scales`, `chords`, and `arrangement` from music.ts. Changing root, pattern, or mode cancels playback. The keyboard enables only matching pattern tones; non-pattern keys are disabled so they do not suggest an unavailable action.

## Song chord changes

The Chord changes tab inside Scales & chords opens [ChordProgression.tsx](../desktop/src/ChordProgression.tsx). Give the chart a title, select a concert root and chord type, then Add chord. The empty state also offers an explicit C–Am–F–G example. Duplicate chords are allowed. Each numbered change can be heard, edited in the composer, moved earlier/later, or removed. Editing offers Save chord and Cancel edit. The working chart saves with the profile, including its title and up to 32 ordered changes; older profiles start with an empty chart. Only one working chart is stored, so export a chart before replacing it for another song.

[ProgressionChart.tsx](../desktop/src/ProgressionChart.tsx) renders one self-contained SVG: title, notation/instrument context, and four changes per row. Each change shows its written or concert symbol, concert chord, spelled chord tones, degrees, and note octaves. The shared `arrangement` function supplies the same spellings and pitches used by the harmony library, including extended chords and double accidentals. Instrument or notation changes update the chart without closing its tab. Small screens scroll inside the chart region without widening the page.

Play changes auditions each chord together in sequence, with the current change highlighted. Each uses a 1.2-second sustain plus the selected voice’s release; this is a listening preview, not metronomic accompaniment. Stop, editing the sequence, opening Settings/the tour, changing instrument/notation, or leaving the screen cancels playback. No practice attempts or achievements are generated by composing or listening.

Save chart as image exports the entire chart as a PNG at twice the SVG resolution, even when part of it is outside the visible viewport. The export removes transient playback highlighting and uses a sanitized title as the filename. Export success/failure is announced. User titles are rendered as text, never injected markup. The chart has a descriptive accessible name and a complete textual description; editing controls have position-specific names and boundary move buttons are disabled.

Model and persistence validation live in [progression.ts](../desktop/src/progression.ts). Tests cover chord spelling/transposition, ordering, malformed saves, persistence, image dimensions, playback cancellation, and narrow layouts. This is a chord-tone reference: it does not include rhythm, inversions, staff notation, a song library, or imported song recognition. Dominant thirteenth uses the existing voicing without the eleventh.

## Play it back

**Layout:** a twelve-note target selector and random-target action sit above the target note, reference playback, microphone action, live detected pitch/tuning feedback, and success state. Input status and a compact local-audio privacy panel stay visible near the microphone controls. The former motivational instruction card is removed.

**Flow:** choose any pitch class from C4 through B4 or request a different random target, hear it, enable the microphone, and play a single steady note. Changing the target stops playback and microphone capture and clears stale feedback. Permission is requested only after user action. Denial or a missing device produces a persistent inline error beside the controls. A pending request can be canceled; late-arriving unused streams are closed. Stopping clears stale detected-pitch feedback. Stopping, succeeding, or leaving closes microphone tracks and the audio context.

**Matching rule:** the detected MIDI note must equal the sounding target and remain within 35 cents for over 650 milliseconds. The target respects the selected instrument and notation. Matching is single-note pitch detection, not chord recognition or instrument identification.

**Implementation:** PlayRoom.tsx uses `getUserMedia`, an analyser with 4096-sample frames, and `detectPitch` in audio.ts. The detector rejects quiet/ambiguous frames and searches approximately 65–1400 Hz. Electron's permission handler allows microphone requests only from the app. Audio is not recorded or uploaded.

## Your progress and storage

**Layout:** daily goal and achievement cards, headline statistics, seven-day activity chart, twelve-note practice map, and lesson journey. A first-use empty state links to practice. Export progress is a visible secondary action.

**Behavior:** show real saved attempts, accuracy, note-level results, and lesson progress. Export downloads a JSON profile. Import, cloud sync, accounts, and cross-device sharing are not implemented. Charts reflect the retained history, not an unlimited lifetime record.

**Implementation:** [store.ts](../desktop/src/store.ts) validates and persists the profile in localStorage under `aurynote.next.v1`. The context profile setter writes each completed state transition synchronously before returning, so a fast reload or window close does not wait for a post-render effect. The profile is now version 2 and includes instrument-key preset (`tuning`), independent playback voice (`sound`), written/concert preference, volume, reference setting, lesson level, completed sessions, learned notes, error weights, and the latest 2,000 attempts. Version 1 piano preferences migrate to C/piano; tenor preferences migrate to B♭ tenor/sax. Existing attempts, lesson progress, and other preferences are retained. Version 2 now also stores customNotes, sessionLength, dailyGoal, passedLessons, tourSeen, and the working song chart with defaults for older saves. Older recommended levels imply earlier guided lessons were passed; the final lesson is not assumed passed. Custom note choices and session length persist; entering ear training defaults to the recommended guided lesson. The continued-development app uses its own storage key so its settings, charts, and progress do not overwrite the submitted app on the same GitHub Pages origin. It starts with a fresh profile; automatic import from the submitted app is not implemented. Invalid data falls back to safe defaults. Discovered pitches are deduplicated, and impossible calendar dates are excluded from saved attempts. Ear-training error weights change only for ear answers; staff and microphone practice still count toward activity without changing listening difficulty. Saving failures trigger a notification. Daily grouping uses local dates.

## Goals and accomplishments

[Milestones.tsx](../desktop/src/Milestones.tsx) renders the goal and achievement presentation on Your Progress. [achievements.ts](../desktop/src/achievements.ts) derives five milestones from persistent counts: first completed session, five completed sessions, five pitches recognized correctly, all twelve pitches recognized correctly, and all five guided lessons passed at 80% or higher. Repeating a passed lesson adds a session but does not add another distinct lesson. A correctly recognized pitch is a discovery, not a claim of mastery.

Each card shows the requirement, current/target counts, a progress bar, and Earned or In progress. Earned cards use a check and restrained green surface. The daily goal displays remaining answers or “Today’s goal reached.” The studio displays a compact daily-goal metric and links to full progress. No decorative achievement cards appear inside a practice question.

## Sound design

[sound.ts](../desktop/src/sound.ts) generates audio samples locally. Piano uses a fast attack, decaying harmonic partials, slight detuning, and a brief hammer-like noise transient. Tenor uses a slower attack, sustained reed-like harmonics, and light breath texture. Clarinet emphasizes odd harmonics for a hollow reed sound; flute emphasizes the fundamental with gentle breath texture; trumpet uses stronger upper harmonics; guitar uses plucked partials that decay faster than piano. All six are synthesized practice voices, not recordings of real instruments.

[audio.ts](../desktop/src/audio.ts) schedules buffers on the Web Audio clock, applies volume, reduces simultaneous-note gain, and tracks sources. Stop fades sources over roughly 15 milliseconds instead of cutting them abruptly. Sequential starts are separated by the requested duration plus 260 milliseconds; piano and sax have different release tails. Playback callbacks drive note highlights and labels. Sound cancellation must prevent stale visual updates as well as stop audio.

Do not add reverb, detuning, or expressive modulation that makes the target pitch harder to identify without testing the effect. Keep comparable loudness between notes and instruments, clear note boundaries, and headroom for chords.

## Accessibility and interaction rules

Use real buttons, labels, visible keyboard focus, and descriptive accessible names. Preserve reduced-motion styles. Use text and symbols alongside color for answers and microphone state. Keep selected modes distinguishable from hover and disabled controls. Announce playback/feedback through status regions without revealing a quiz answer early.

Existing support includes focus styles, status messages, labeled controls, SVG descriptions, and reduced-motion handling. A complete screen-reader audit and modal focus-management audit have not been completed; do not describe the app as fully accessibility-certified.

## Implementation boundaries

## Change workflow

For every feature addition or change, update this document in the same change set:

- Describe its purpose and entry point.
- Record layout, controls, states, feedback, timing, and keyboard/accessibility behavior.
- Explain affected sound, notation, data, and permission behavior.
- Link the implementation and note relevant validation or remaining limits.
- Update existing sections instead of leaving contradictory descriptions.
- Add a short entry below. Keep proposed work separate from shipped behavior.

Verify relevant behavior and inspect changed screens. Audio changes need pitch, envelope, clipping, and playback checks; automated tests do not replace listening on real output devices. Microphone checks include simulated input, but real instruments and hardware still need field testing.

## GitHub micro-commit workflow

This is a development requirement, not an in-app feature. Make frequent, small commits as work progresses, with one meaningful change per commit. Separate independent UI, sound, behavior, test, and documentation changes when practical. Keep checkpoints coherent; avoid empty commits or arbitrary splits made only to inflate the count.

Use short, plain messages such as `Improve sax sounds` or `Label playback steps`. Stage only task-related files, perform relevant checks, and push completed commits to the active task branch. Preserve the individual commits. Continued development uses `main` or feature branches in `Xrkt117/Aurynote-next`. The original `Xrkt117/Aurynote` repository, its `hackathon-overhaul` branch, and its Pages deployment remain frozen. Never publish continued-development changes to that repository. Squashing or force-pushing requires an explicit user request. The persistent instructions are in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Hosting and submission separation

The continued app is published at https://xrkt117.github.io/Aurynote-next/ from this repository’s `main` branch. The original submission lives at https://xrkt117.github.io/Aurynote/ and is not updated by this project.

[deploy-pages.yml](../.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) runs tests and a production build, uploads `desktop/dist`, and deploys with GitHub Pages Actions. A repository-and-branch guard permits deployment only from `Xrkt117/Aurynote-next` on `main`. Relative Vite asset paths support the repository subdirectory. Pages must be configured with GitHub Actions as the source. The previous wait for a separate branch-based deployment is removed because this site has only the Actions source.

In the working checkout, `origin` points to Aurynote-next and is the default push destination. The `submission` remote is available for reads, with a disabled push URL. This is local configuration; newly cloned copies of Aurynote-next use their own origin normally. Separate localStorage keys prevent practice data from crossing between these two sites even though GitHub Pages hosts them on the same origin.
